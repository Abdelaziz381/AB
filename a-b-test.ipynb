For this project, you will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website.  Your goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should:\n- Implement the new webpage, \n- Keep the old webpage, or \n- Perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.\n\nEach **ToDo** task below has an associated quiz present in the classroom.  Though the classroom quizzes are **not necessary** to complete the project, they help ensure you are on the right track as you work through the project, and you can feel more confident in your final submission meeting the [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1214/view) specification. \n\n>**Tip**: Though it's not a mandate, students can attempt the classroom quizzes to ensure statistical numeric values are calculated correctly in many cases.\n\n<a id='probability'></a>\n## Part I - Probability\n\nTo get started, let's import our libraries.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### ToDo 1.1\nNow, read in the `ab_data.csv` data.

[Here](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/generated/statsmodels.stats.proportion.proportions_ztest.html) is a helpful link on using the built in.\n\nThe syntax is: \n```bash\nproportions_ztest(count_array, nobs_array, alternative='larger')\n```\nwhere, \n- `count_array` = represents the number of \"converted\" for each group\n- `nobs_array` = represents the total number of observations (rows) in each group\n- `alternative` = choose one of the values from `[‘two-sided’, ‘smaller’, ‘larger’]` depending upon two-tailed, left-tailed, or right-tailed respectively. \n>**Hint**: <br>\nIt's a two-tailed if you defined $H_1$ as $(p_{new} = p_{old})$. <br>\nIt's a left-tailed if you defined $H_1$ as $(p_{new} < p_{old})$. <br>\nIt's a right-tailed if you defined $H_1$ as $(p_{new} > p_{old})$. \n\nThe built-in function above will return the z_score, p_value. \n\n---\n### About the two-sample z-test\nRecall that you have plotted a distribution `p_diffs` representing the\ndifference in the \"converted\" probability  $(p{'}_{new}-p{'}_{old})$  for your two simulated samples 10,000 times. \n\nAnother way for comparing the mean of two independent and normal distribution is a **two-sample z-test**. You can perform the Z-test to calculate the Z_score, as shown in the equation below:\n\n$$\nZ_{score} = \\frac{ (p{'}_{new}-p{'}_{old}) - (p_{new}  -  p_{old})}{ \\sqrt{ \\frac{\\sigma^{2}_{new} }{n_{new}} + \\frac{\\sigma^{2}_{old} }{n_{old}}  } }\n$$\n\nwhere,\n- $p{'}$ is the \"converted\" success rate in the sample\n- $p_{new}$ and $p_{old}$ are the \"converted\" success rate for the two groups in the population. \n- $\\sigma_{new}$ and $\\sigma_{new}$ are the standard deviation for the two groups in the population. \n- $n_{new}$ and $n_{old}$ represent the size of the two groups or samples (it's same in our case)\n\n\n>Z-test is performed when the sample size is large, and the population variance is known. The z-score represents the distance between the two \"converted\" success rates in terms of the standard error. \n\nNext step is to make a decision to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis based on comparing these two values: \n- $Z_{score}$\n- $Z_{\\alpha}$ or $Z_{0.05}$, also known as critical value at 95% confidence interval.  $Z_{0.05}$ is 1.645 for one-tailed tests,  and 1.960 for two-tailed test. You can determine the $Z_{\\alpha}$ from the z-table manually. \n\nDecide if your hypothesis is either a two-tailed, left-tailed, or right-tailed test. Accordingly, reject OR fail to reject the  null based on the comparison between $Z_{score}$ and $Z_{\\alpha}$. We determine whether or not the $Z_{score}$ lies in the \"rejection region\" in the distribution. In other words, a \"rejection region\" is an interval where the null hypothesis is rejected iff the $Z_{score}$ lies in that region.\n\n>Hint:<br>\nFor a right-tailed test, reject null if $Z_{score}$ > $Z_{\\alpha}$. <br>\nFor a left-tailed test, reject null if $Z_{score}$ < $Z_{\\alpha}$. \n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import statsmodels.api as sm\n# ToDo: Complete the sm.stats.proportions_ztest() method arguments\ncount_array = np.array([convert_new, convert_old])\nnobs_array = np.array([n_old, n_new])\n\n\nz_score, p_value = sm.stats.proportions_ztest([convert_new, convert_old], [n_new, n_old], alternative='two-sided')\n\nprint(\"this is z_score {}\".format(z_score))\nprint(\"this is p_value {}\".format(p_value))\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-13T20:59:15.781431Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-13T20:59:15.78193Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-13T20:59:15.789055Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-13T20:59:15.781882Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-13T20:59:15.788472Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**n.** What do the z-score and p-value you computed in the previous question mean for the conversion rates of the old and new pages?
